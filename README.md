# Flatland
This is my first game with SDL2 and C++. It was inspired by the game Flatland in [Fancade](https://youtu.be/NxWOc8AiSH0?si=zXEuSz1gtdwaaVNd). Fancade is a very simple game engine where you can create your own games without a line of code! Watch the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/hAlUGmw1Qlw?si=jjxBiTqTazjnhdRn). The original game was created by [Martin Magni](https://www.youtube.com/@MartinMagni). Try it [here](https://play.fancade.com/5BD5944CAA9BB5E0)!
